### About
This guide presents best practices related to ressource assessment and is a collaborative effort within the International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme Task 16. The guide covers a wide range of topics including solar radiationm modelling, assessing solar data quality, where to obtain solar data and how to manipulate. The aim is to disseminate best practices and further the adoption of state-of-the-art methods.

Contrary to traditional textbooks, this guide presents a general description of the topic along with documented how-to examples using Python code. This is achieve using a series of Jupyter Notebooks, which allows for seamless presentation of a explanatory text, code examples, figures, mathematical equations and references. Python was chosen due to it being open-source, easy to learna and also being the primary choice for most [open-source solar and PV libraries](openpvtools.readthedocs.io), including PVlib Python which will be used extensively.

Solar resource assessment is advancing rapidly, however, while these new advances are published in great detail in scientific journals, a large gap is left in the path to widespread adoption by the scientific community and industry. Often, the high complexity of these new methods and models make them only practically available to a small group of dedicated experts. This guide aims to close this gap by demonstrating how to apply state of the art solar resource assessment techniques in practice. With this mode of open-source dissemination, users can easily copy code examples and, with minimal effort, modify them to the fit their own application.
