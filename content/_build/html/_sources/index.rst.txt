Solar Resource Assessment in Python
===================================


This guide presents best practices related to solar resource assessment and it is a collaborative effort within the International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme Task 16 PVPST16_. The guide covers a wide range of topics including solar radiation modelling, data quality assessment, and how to obtain and manipulate solar data. The aim is to disseminate best practices and further the adoption of state-of-the-art methods.

Solar resource assessment is advancing rapidly and while new advances are published in great detail in scientific journals, a large gap is left in the path to widespread adoption by the scientific community and industry. Often, the high complexity of these new methods and models make them only practically available to a small group of dedicated experts. This guide aims to close this gap by demonstrating how to apply state-of-the-art solar resource assessment techniques in practice. With this mode of open-source dissemination, users can easily copy code examples and, with minimal effort, modify them to the fit their own application.

Contrary to traditional textbooks, this guide presents a general introduction of the topics along with documented how-to examples using Python code. This is achieve by using Jupyter Notebooks, which permits a seamless integration of a explanatory text, code examples, figures, mathematical equations, and references. Python was chosen as it is open-source, easy to learn and the primary choice for the majority of [open-source solar and PV libraries](https://openpvtools.readthedocs.io), including [PVLIB Python](https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which will be used extensively in this guide.
